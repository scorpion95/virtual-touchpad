This is for Android. There is no cursor or pointer by the moment in Android but we will have it with this app.

There is an allready existant , not free, not opensource app that looks like this called "Virtual Trackball". You can find it on the web. That app has no cursor by the moment. And it has many things I would like to change. https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pedrocorp.virtualtrackball

We need to know:
  * How do we make an app always on top?
  * How do we send events programaticaly to other app?
    * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1157603/programmatically-click-views-in-android
  * How do we know who app should receive the virtual event?
