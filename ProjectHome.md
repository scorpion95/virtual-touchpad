A piece of the touchscreen or all (customizable) behaves like a touchpad to crontrol a moue pointer or cursor.

**The virtual touchpad area must be allways on top.**The virtual cursor must be always on top also.
**One click on the touchpad area is decoded as a virtual click wherever the virtual cursor is.**On the side of the touchpad area there will be a settings button.
**Virtual Clicks over touchpad area should not be thranfered to the touchpad area but to the app below it.**Setings are:
  * movement ratio (toucharea move / cursor screen move )
  * close app.
  * opacity of the touch area.
  * move touchpad area.
  * resize touchpad area.
  * etc.
**It is useful when you need more presition than your finger. Or when you need to see behind your finger while clicking. It is also useful for Android devices with screens that are not all the area sensible but part of it like Nook Classic.**

By the moment we are looking for examples on how to do it:

How to make an app always on top.
How to draw the cursor.
How to send the virtual pointer actions (onMove, onUp onDown) to the other apps.
